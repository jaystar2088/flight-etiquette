# Flight Etiquette
## Apprpriate Number of Times to Leave Seat on a 6 Hour Long Flight
For this data visualization project, I used data from **FiveThirtyEight** which recorded respondents' answers to various questions related to flight etiquette. I chose to create a bar chart visualizing answers to the question: _"On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?"_ I found this question most interesting because I recently traveled a similar distance from SFO to YYZ and was asked to stand approximately three times so the lady sitting next to me could use the restroom. She was super apologetic for inconveniencing me, but I reassured her that it was no big deal, and that I'd happily stand as many times as reasonably necessary.

We see from the data visualization above, created with **Datawrapper**, that most respondents believe the lady sitting next to me was exercising appropriate flight etiquette by leaving her seat three times during the 6 hour flight. While a good number of respondents believe two is the maximum amount of times to maintain flight etiquette, almost double as many believe at least three is appropriate (when factoring in the number of respondents who answered four times and more than five times).
